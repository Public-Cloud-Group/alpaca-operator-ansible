  2.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Convert all Ansible module parameters from camelCase to snake_case to comply
        with Python and Ansible naming conventions. This is a breaking change that
        requires updating existing playbooks. API payload keys remain in camelCase
        as required by the ALPACA REST API.
      bugfixes:
      - Add check_mode support documentation in attributes section and remove unsupported
        'supports_check_mode' field from module documentation.
      - Add missing periods to argument descriptions in module documentation to comply
        with Ansible documentation standards.
      - Add semantic markup (V(), O(), M()) to module documentation descriptions for
        better readability and compliance with Ansible standards.
      - Ensure Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCNs) are used for all plugins and
        modules, including ansible.builtin modules, in all documentation, examples,
        and return sections.
      - Fix invalid documentation markup by using full paths for nested options in
        O() directives (e.g., O(command.agent_id)).
      - Remove maximum version cap from requires_ansible field in meta/runtime.yml.
      - Remove periods from return value descriptions in RETURN sections to comply
        with Ansible documentation standards.
      - Replace 'Ansible' with 'ansible-core' in requirements fields and documentation
        to accurately reflect the dependency.
      - alpaca_system - Fix TypeError by adding missing 'desired_vars' argument to
        build_variable_payload() function call.
      major_changes:
      - All module parameters/arguments now follow snake_case naming (e.g., 'apiConnection'
        is now 'api_connection', 'magicNumber' is now 'magic_number').
      - Updated all module documentation, examples, and playbooks to reflect the new
        snake_case parameter names.
      minor_changes:
      - Add best practices section for managing RFC passwords to maintain idempotency.
      - Add comprehensive documentation in changelogs/fragments/README.md explaining
        how to create and manage changelog fragments.
      - Add manual changelog generation script .dev/scripts/generate_changelog.sh
        for local testing and verification.
      - Add requirements section to module documentation indicating minimum supported
        ALPACA Operator version.
      - Document non-idempotent behavior of alpaca_system module when rfc_connection.password
        is specified.
      - Introduce changelog fragment system using antsibull-changelog for automatic
        changelog generation from structured fragment files.
      - Merge QUICK_START.md into index.md for consolidated getting started documentation.
